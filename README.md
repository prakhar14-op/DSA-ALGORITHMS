## 📖 Abstract

This repository serves as a centralized archive for Data Structures and Algorithms implemented purely in **C++**. It documents a systematic approach to understanding computational logic, memory management, and algorithmic efficiency.

The objective of this project is to provide optimized, well-documented solutions to standard computer science problems, ranging from fundamental Abstract Data Types (ADTs) to complex non-linear data structures. It also includes practical problem-solving implementations derived from competitive programming platforms such as LeetCode.

## 📂 Repository Architecture

The codebase is organized by data structure categories and algorithmic paradigms to ensure modularity and ease of navigation.

| Directory / Module | Description & Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **📁 Array & ADT** | Fundamental implementation of Array Abstract Data Types. Includes operations for insertion, deletion, searching (Linear/Binary), and memory resizing logic. |
| **📁 Array_LeetCode** | A collection of optimized solutions for array-based problems on LeetCode. Focuses on sliding window, two-pointer, and prefix sum techniques. |
| **📁 Linked List** | Implementation of dynamic linear data structures. Covers Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists with standard CRUD operations and pointer manipulation. |
| **📁 Stack** | LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) implementations using both arrays and linked lists. Includes applications such as parenthesis matching and expression conversion. |
| **📁 Queue** | FIFO (First-In-First-Out) implementations. Covers Linear Queues, Circular Queues, and introductory Priority Queue logic. |
| **📁 Binary Search Tree** | Hierarchical data structure implementation. Focuses on BST logic, recursive insertion/deletion, and search complexity analysis ($O(\log n)$). |
| **📁 trees/creating-tree** | Core construction algorithms for generic binary trees and various traversal methodologies (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, Level-order). |
| **📁 sorting-techniques** | A library of sorting algorithms including Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, and Merge Sort, analyzed for time complexity. |
| **📁 jan_streak** | Daily coding logs tracking consistency in solving "Problem of the Day" challenges, demonstrating continuous improvement. |
